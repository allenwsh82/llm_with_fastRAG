# llm_with_fastRAG

fastRAG is a research framework for efficient and optimized retrieval augmented generative pipelines, incorporating state-of-the-art LLMs and Information Retrieval. fastRAG is designed to empower researchers and developers with a comprehensive tool-set for advancing retrieval augmented generation.

Key Features:

Optimized RAG: Build RAG pipelines with SOTA efficient components for greater compute efficiency.
Optimized for Intel Hardware: Leverage Intel extensions for PyTorch (IPEX), ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel and ðŸ¤— Optimum-Habana for running as optimal as possible on IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Processors and IntelÂ® GaudiÂ® AI accelerators.
Customizable: fastRAG is built using Haystack and HuggingFace. All of fastRAG's components are 100% Haystack compatible.
